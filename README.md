### What is Sayxiis?

It is a app for who is tired for not be able to see anymore only photos on instagram or the photographers that you like. You can‚Äôt see any more their work because of the all random people with short videos came trying to seduce you. In this app you will be allowed only post photos, have a profile with your photos and the most fun part, it will have some kind of small competion like: ‚Äútoday only sky photos‚Äù and with tags and ranks (people will be able to vote in the photos) you can have fun doing it with others. Also I want at the end of the "day tag" (will reset at the midnight) the person with more votes get a "win sticker" that will show in their profile and everyone can compete to have a sticker and have fun posting a day tag photo.
